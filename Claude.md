# Claude Guide

This repository provides resources for working with Anthropic's Claude agent.

## Project Orientation

- Review `.serena/memories/architecture_overview.md` and `.serena/memories/component-inventory.md`
  for an overview of the system and components.
- Use `rg` for code searches instead of recursive `grep`.
- Run `npm test` and `npm run lint` to verify changes before committing.

## Commands

Custom command definitions for Claude live in `.claude/commands/`.
