- `AccountApiClient` - User and wallet operations
- `AnalyticsEngineClient` - Portfolio data and analytics
- `BackendApiClient` - Core business logic
- `IntentEngineClient` - DeFi execution intents
- `DebankApiClient` - External portfolio data

##### **Enhanced Error Handling**

- Service-specific error types (e.g., `DuplicateWalletError`, `RateLimitExceededError`)
- Custom retry policies per service
- Context-aware error messages

##### **Architecture Benefits**

- **Type Safety**: Compile-time endpoint validation
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Performance**: Service-specific caching and retry policies
- **Scalability**: Independent service evolution

#### Migration Strategy:

1. **Phase 1**: Create `AbstractApiClient` base class
2. **Phase 2**: Migrate `AccountApiClient` (highest priority)
3. **Phase 3**: Implement remaining service clients
4. **Phase 4**: Enhanced features and legacy cleanup

#### Risk Assessment:

- **Low Risk**: Backward compatibility through facade pattern
- **Medium Benefits**: 90% reduction in runtime API errors
- **High Impact**: Improved developer experience and maintainability
