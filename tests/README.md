# Test Strategy for Solo Developer

## Philosophy

As a solo developer, you need tests that **help you ship confidently** without wasting time on flaky
failures.

## Current Test Setup

### âœ… Essential Tests (`npm run test`)

**Fast, reliable tests that catch real issues:**

**Basic Functionality (9 tests):**

- **Page loads without errors** - Catches build/deployment issues
- **Button hover states work** - Ensures good UX (with warnings, not failures)
- **Navigation exists** - Basic functionality check
- **No broken images** - Asset loading verification
- **Responsive design** - Works on desktop and mobile
- **Investment buttons functional** - Core business flow
- **Performance check** - Page loads under 5 seconds
- **No console errors** - JavaScript health check

**Business Critical (6 tests):**

- **Investment flow accessible** - Revenue-generating features work
- **Wallet/Portfolio features** - Core platform functionality
- **Navigation enables discovery** - Users can find features
- **User inputs work** - Forms and data entry
- **Visual feedback** - Hover states and responsiveness
- **Error handling** - Graceful failure handling

**Runtime: ~10 seconds** âš¡ | **Coverage: ðŸ“Š Tracks 15+ components and interactions**

### Other Commands

```bash
npm run test           # Essential + Business tests (recommended)
npm run test:essential # Just the basics (9 tests, ~3 seconds)
npm run test:business  # Business-critical tests (6 tests, ~4 seconds)
npm run test:journey   # User journey tests (5 tests, ~5 seconds)
npm run test:full      # All reliable tests (20 tests, ~15 seconds)
npm run test:coverage  # Full coverage report
npm run test:smoke     # Fastest smoke test (3 tests, ~2 seconds)
npm run test:dev       # Run with browser visible for debugging
npm run test:all       # Run ALL tests (including flaky archived ones)
```

### ðŸ“Š Coverage Tracking

Our tests now include **simple coverage tracking** that shows:

- **Components tested** (Navigation, InvestmentFlow, WalletPortfolio, etc.)
- **Interactions verified** (ButtonClicks, FormInputs, ResponsiveDesign, etc.)
- **Business feature coverage** (Investment buttons, Portfolio data, etc.)

No complex tooling needed - coverage info prints in the test output!

## What We DON'T Test

- Complex navigation flows (too flaky)
- Detailed UI state management (changes too often)
- Pixel-perfect styling (not critical for solo dev)
- Every possible user interaction (time-consuming)

## When to Run Tests

- **Before each deployment** (`npm run test`)
- **After major changes** (`npm run test`)
- **When debugging issues** (`npm run test:dev`)

## Adding New Tests

Only add tests for:

1. **Critical business functionality** (payment, signup, etc.)
2. **Features that frequently break** (based on actual bugs)
3. **Performance regressions** (loading time, errors)

## Archived Tests

Complex tests that were too flaky are in `tests/archive/`. These can be useful for debugging
specific issues but shouldn't run automatically.

## Test Philosophy Summary

**Better to have 9 reliable tests than 50 flaky ones.** Focus on catching the issues that would
actually hurt your business or users.
